# EI beneficiaries in Canada

A responsive line chart implemented with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) and [D3](https://d3js.org/) showing
Employment Insurance (EI) beneficiaries in Canada and its provinces and territories between 2019 and 2021.

Hovering over the chart causes tooltips containing the month and the number of EI beneficiaries to appear.

This project was bootstrapped with the [Svelte app template](https://github.com/sveltejs/template). The geography selector was implemented with [svelte-select](https://github.com/rob-balfre/svelte-select).
